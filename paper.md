# Summary

GOBLIN Lite is a Python-based tool for evaluating land balance and AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use) scenarios specifically tailored to the Irish context. Building upon the GOBLIN framework, it offers increased resolution and aligns with Ireland's National Inventory Report methodologies (including the CBM-CFS3 carbon accounting model). This integration enhances accuracy and makes GOBLIN Lite ideal for detailed national policymaking.  Crucially, it calculates emissions across diverse life cycle assessment impact categories, providing policymakers and researchers with a nuanced tool to explore the environmental and economic trade-offs of land-use decisions.

# Statement of need

Ireland's complex AFOLU emissions profile necessitates a modeling tool that captures both major sources and sinks. `GOBLIN Lite` is designed for this purpose. It calculates CO2 fluxes from varied soil types and forests, along with CH4 emissions from livestock activities. Further, it models nitrogen (N) losses, including N2O, NH3, and dissolved forms, across the agricultural landscape.  `GOBLIN Lite`'s enhanced resolution – in herd dynamics, soil-specific spared area modeling, and additional impact categories –  surpasses the original GOBLIN model [@Duffy:2022]. It integrates Tier 3 forest modeling for additional resolution and alignment with Irish National Inventory reporting. This makes GOBLIN Lite a powerful asset for policymakers, researchers, and students, as evidenced by its use in impactful "net-zero" pathway studies.

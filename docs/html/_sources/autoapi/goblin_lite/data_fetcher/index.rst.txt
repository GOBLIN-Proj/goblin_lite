   .. py:method:: get_landuse_emissions_totals()

      Get the land use emissions totals by gas.

      This method retrieves a dataframe that summarizes the total emissions for each land use category, categorized by different gas types
      such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, as well as a combined total in CO2E (CO2 equivalent).

      :returns:     A dataframe containing the total emissions for each land use category, categorized by different gas types including CO2, CH4,
                    and N2O, as well as a combined total in CO2E (CO2 equivalent). The emissions are reported in kilotons of CO2, CH4, and N2O
                    for each land use category, providing an overview of the greenhouse gas contributions from land use activities.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame

      .. note::

         Land use activities can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions through various processes, including soil management, crop residue
         decomposition, and land-use change. The emissions are reported in CO2, CH4, and N2O, and the combined CO2E allows for a unified
         measure of the overall greenhouse gas impact.
         
         Reported in kilotons.


   .. py:method:: get_forest_flux()

      Get the forest carbon annual flux.

      This method retrieves a dataframe that provides the forest carbon annual flux, reported in metric tons of carbon (tC). The flux is
      categorized into different components, including biomass, dead organic matter (DOM), and total ecosystem, which represents the combined
      biomass and DOM flux. Additionally, the carbon from harvested wood products are also reported.

      :returns:     A dataframe containing the forest carbon annual flux, categorized into different components such as biomass, dead organic
                    matter (DOM), and total ecosystem (combined biomass and DOM). The emissions from harvested wood products are also included in
                    the report. The flux is reported in metric tons of carbon (tC), providing valuable insights into the carbon dynamics of forest
                    ecosystems and their contributions to the carbon cycle.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame

      .. note::

         Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in sequestering and releasing carbon through various processes. The annual carbon flux provides
         information on the net carbon exchange between the forest and the atmosphere, helping to understand the carbon balance and potential
         impacts on climate change.
         
         Reported in tons.


   .. py:method:: get_forest_aggregate()

      Get the aggregated forest carbon emissions.

      This method retrieves a dataframe that provides the aggregated forest carbon emissions, including biomass, dead organic matter (DOM),
      and total ecosystem carbon. The reported values are in metric tons of carbon (tC). The dataframe contains information on the overall
      carbon storage and release within the forest ecosystem, including both living biomass and dead organic matter components.
      Additionally, the carbon from harvested wood products are also reported.

      :returns:     A dataframe containing the aggregated forest carbon emissions, including biomass, dead organic matter (DOM), and total ecosystem
                    carbon. The values are reported in metric tons of carbon (tC), providing valuable insights into the carbon storage and dynamics
                    of the forest ecosystem.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame

      .. note::

         Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, serving as a significant carbon sink. The aggregated forest carbon
         emissions data help quantify the overall carbon balance of the forest, considering both carbon uptake through photosynthesis and
         carbon release through decomposition and disturbances. Understanding the carbon dynamics in forests is essential for assessing their
         contribution to climate change mitigation efforts and evaluating the impacts of various management practices on carbon sequestration.

   .. py:method:: get_total_afforested()

      Get the total afforested area for each scenario.

      This method retrieves a dataframe that provides the total area afforested in each scenario. The values are reported in hectares (ha),
      representing the extent of land that has been converted to forest through afforestation. The afforested areas are essential indicators
      of reforestation efforts and land-use changes to promote carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation.

      :returns:     A dataframe containing the total afforested area for each scenario. The values are reported in hectares (ha) and offer insights
                    into the scale and impact of afforestation efforts within different land-use scenarios.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame

      .. note::

         Afforestation involves converting non-forested land into forested areas. This land-use change plays a vital role in carbon sequestration,
         helping to offset carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Additionally, afforested areas can contribute to enhancing biodiversity,
         ecosystem services, and sustainable land management practices.
